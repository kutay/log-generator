= log-generator

This Go application can be used to generate logs with various parameters, at startup or on demand.

It started as a toy project to test my Filebeat configuration, but I'm also using the opportunity to learn some Go.
This is the first time I write Go code, so be cautious :-)

There is a public docker image available here : https://hub.docker.com/r/orkhonfr/log-generator


== Configuration

For now, there isn't much configuration available.

== Usage

The app expose an HTTP endpoint on port 8090.
There is a swagger doc at /swagger with all available routes.


== Kubernetes

There is a very basic Kubernetes Deployment and Service manifests in the kubernetes folder.
